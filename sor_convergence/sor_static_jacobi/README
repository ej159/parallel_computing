This is the algorithm implementing Jacobi iteration to solve PDE. 
U(k+1) is independent of that of every other, i.e. it removes the dependency in the iteration space. 

Please note that this algorithm increases the number of interations used to converge!
Parallelism should be really helpful in this case.
